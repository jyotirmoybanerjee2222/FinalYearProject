test 1:

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard . It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions . The Netscape created the first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, in 1993 . The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994 The new language was created by Netscape's Eich in 1995 . Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript . The name has caused confusion, implying that it is related to Java . In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to . This led to the release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997 . The JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web . By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95% . Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market .

The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building . It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres . It is now taller than the Chrysler Building in New York City by 5.2 metres (17 ft) Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France .

test 4:

BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension . BART is trained by corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function and learning a model to reconstruct the original text . It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture . BART is particularly effective when tuned for text generation but also works well for compre- hension tasks . It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD . BART achieves new state- of-the-art results on a range of abstractive di- alogue, question answering, and summariza- tion tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE . BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a BART is a denoising autoencoder built with a sequence-to-sequence model that is applicable to a wide range of end tasks . BART pre-trains a model combining Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers . BART uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture . A key advantage of this setup is the noising noising . arbitrary transformations can be applied to the orig- inal text, including changing its length . BART generalizes the original word masking and next sentence prediction objectives in BERT by forcing the model to reason more about overall sentence length . BART is particularly effective when ﬁne tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehen- sion tasks . It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SQuAD . Autoregressive Encoder is predicted auto-regressively, meaning GPT can be used for generation . BART: Inputs to the encoder need not be aligned with decoder outputs, allowing arbitary noise transformations . GPT: Words can only condition on leftward context, so it cannot learn bidirec-tional interactions . BART is a comparison of BART with BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) BART is a denoising autoencoder that maps a corrupted document to the original document it was derived from . BART is implemented as a sequence-to-sequence model with a bidirectional encoder over corrupted text . BART exhibits the most consistently strong perfor- mance across the full range of tasks we consider . BART uses the standard sequence-to-sequence Trans- former architecture from (Vaswani et al., 2017), ex- cept, that we modify ReLU activa- tion functions to GeLUs (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) For our base model, we use 6 layers in the encoder and de- coder, and for our large model we use 12 layers in each . BART con- tains roughly 10% more parameters than Pre-training BART BART is trained by corrupting documents and then op- timizing a reconstruction loss . BART allows us to apply any type of document corruption . In the extreme case, all information about the source is lost, BART is equivalent to a language model . The transformations we used are summarized below . Text inﬁlling is inspired by Span- BERT (Joshi et al., 2019), but SpanBERT samples span lengths from a different (clamped geometric) dis- tribution, and replaces each span with a sequence of [MASK] tokens of exactly the same length . A document is divided into sentences based on full stops, and these sentences are shufﬂed in a random order . Document Rotation a token is chosen uniformly at random, The representations produced by BART can be used in several ways for downstream applications . For sequence classiﬁcation tasks, the same input is fed into the encoder and decoder . This task trains the model to identify the start of the document . Because BART has an autoregressive decoder, it can be tuned for sequence generation tasks such as abstractive question answering and summarization . We also explore using BART to improve machine trans- lation decoders for translating into English . We show that it is possible to use the entire BART model (both encoder and de- coder) as a single pretrained decoder . The model is trained end-to-end, which trains the new encoder to map foreign words into an input that BART can de-noise to English . BART supports a much wider range of noising schemes during pre-training than previous work . We compare a range of options using base-size models (6 encoder and 6 decoder layers, with a hidden size of 768), evaluated on a subset of the tasks we will consider for the full large scale experiments in §5.1 . We aim, as much as possible, to control for differences un-related to the pre-training objective . We train a left-to-right Transformer language model . This model is equivalent to the BART decoder, without cross-attention . We train a Masked Language Model with additional self-attention masks . For con- sistency with other models, we do not implement relative positional embeddings or attention across seg- ments from XLNet . We replace 15% of tokens with [MASK] symbols, and train the model to independently predict the original tokens . For the Permuted LM, Masked LM and Multitask LM, we use two-stream attention (Yang et al., 2019) to efﬁciently compute likelihoods of the output part of the sequence . We experiment with treating task as a stan- dard sequence-to-sequence problem, where the source input to the encoder and the target is the decoder out- put . Similar to BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), we use concate- nated question and context as input to the encoder of BART, and additionally pass them to the decoder . The model includes classiﬁers to predict the start and end indices of each token . In contrast to the representation of the EOS token is used to classify the sentences relations . Summaries here are typically closely related to source sentences . All models are of comparable size and trained for 1M steps on a combination of books and Wikipedia data . The results are shown in Table 1: Comparison of pre-training objectives . Entries in the bottom two blocks are trained on identical data using the same code-base, and ﬁne-tuned with the same procedures . Performance of pre-training methods varies signiﬁ- cantly across tasks . Deletion appears to outperform masking on generation tasks . Left-to-right pre-training improves generation . The Masked Language Model and the Permuted Language Model perform less well than others on generation . BART achieves similar performance with only half the number of bidirectional layers . Bidirectional encoders are crucial for SQuAD . The ELI5 dataset is an outlier, with much higher perplex- ities than other tasks . BART models using text-in-lling perform well on all tasks . A pure lan- guage model performs best, suggesting that BART is less effective when the output is only loosely con- strained by the input . We use a batch size of 8000, and train the model for 500,000 steps . Docu- ments are tokenized with the same byte-pair encoding as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). We mask 30% of tokens in each document, and permute all sentences . BART performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet . BART’s uni-directional decoder layers do not reduce performance on discriminative tasks . BART outperforms previous work on summarization on two tasks and all metrics . BART performs simi- larly, with only small differences between the models on most tasks . BART’s improvements on generation tasks do not come at the expense of clas- siﬁcation performance . BART is a sequence-to-sequence model from the input to the output text . BART outperforms previous work on conver- sational response generation . Summaries in the CNN/DailyMail tend to resemble source sentences . Extractive models do well here, and even the baseline of the ﬁrst-three-three source sentences is highly competitive . BART outperforms previous work on two automated metrics . We evaluate dialogue response generation on CONVAI2 (Dinan et al., 2019) We evaluate the best previous work, which leverages BERT, by roughly 6.0 points on all ROUGE metrics . In contrast, XSum is highly abstractive, and extrac- tive models perform poorly . We also evaluated performance on WMT16 Romanian- English, augmented with back-translation data from Sennrich et al. (2016) We use a 6-layer transformer source encoder to map Romanian into a representation that BART is able to de-noise into English . BART outperforms the best pre-training work by 1.2 ROUGE-L . We compare our results against a baseline Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) with Transformer- large settings (the baseline row) We show the performance of both steps of our model in the ﬁxed BART and tuned BART rows . BART shows large improvements on summarization metrics of up to 6 points over the prior state-of-the-art . The BART pretrain- ing has learned a strong combination of natural lan- guage understanding and generation . The model output is generally factually accurate, and inte- grates supporting evidence from across the input doc- ument with background knowledge . Early methods for pretraining were based on language models . GPT only models left- ward context, which is problematic for some tasks . ELMo concatenates left-only and right-only representations, but does not pre-train inter- actions between these features . BERT introduced masked lan- guage modelling, which allows pre-training to learn in- teractions between left and right context words . BART re- duces the mismatch between pre-training and generative tasks, because the decoder is always trained on un- corrupted context . UniLM predictions are conditionally indepenen- dent, whereas BART’s are autoregressive . MASS is perhaps the most similar model to BART . XL-Net (Yang et al., 2019) extends BERT by pre- training . Fisheries off the coast of Fiji are protect- ing coral reefs from the effects of global warming, according to a study in the jour- nal Science . Boris Johnson has said he will raise the is- sue of US diplomat Anne Sacoolas’ diplo-c collision .

This is the ﬁrst time anyone has been recorded to run a full marathon of 42.195 kilometers (approximately 26 miles) under this pursued landmark time . It was not, however, an ofﬁcially sanctioned world record, as it was not an ”open race” of IAAF . PG&E scheduled the blackouts in response to forecasts for high winds amid dry conditions . The aim is to reduce the risk of wildﬁres . Nearly 800 thousand customers were scheduled to be affected by the shutoffs which were expected to last until midday tomorrow . BART is a pre-training approach that learns to map corrupted documents to the original . BART achieves similar performance to RoBERTa on discriminative tasks, while achieving new state-of-the-art results on a number of text generation tasks .
